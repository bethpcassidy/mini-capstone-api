# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Supplier.create!(name: "Amazon", email: "amazon@email.com", phone_number: "243222342")

# supplier = Supplier.create(name: "Plush Factory", email: "plush@mail.com", phone_number: "555-555-5555")

# Image.create!(name: "Amazon", email: "amazon@email.com", phone_number: "243222342")
